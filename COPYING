Xonotic Licensing
=================


Scope
-----

This licensing document pertains to:

- Official Xonotic releases

- The Team Xonotic-owned branches (i.e. those whose name does not contain a
  slash, like "master" and "div0-stable") of the repositories on
  git://git.xonotic.org/xonotic/ including all their ancestor commits

Team Xonotic does not make any guarantees for licensing or legal status of any
content not distributed as part of official Xonotic releases or Team
Xonotic-owned branches, such as:

- Files downloaded from a web server by Xonotic (e.g. automatic map downloads)

- Branches of our repository that are owned by a user of the repository, and
  thus not owned by Team Xonotic (these branches are always prefixed with user
  name and a slash, as in "divVerent/")

For status of such content, please contact its author.
