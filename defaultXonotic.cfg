//There are too many to re-export to obey the new way things are done
//Most of the IQM models only use bones, in XCE, for position info: they dont animate

//It would be nice if the forked (very slightly) version of Darkpaces we use
//had a per-entity setting that skips all the skel animation code 
//or whatever is slowing down IQMs over 3.5 MB
//(Other nice features would be greater max entity cap (to millions or billions))
//(volumetric terrain that can be dug in etc (think minecraft but smoothed, or 7days))
//(ability to set plane bounds on the rendering of an entitiy's model)
//(IE: don't render past this plane, "cut plane")

//Note: Some newer versions of DP also don't render water correctly on older intel cards
//This is another reason for staying with a known working version for those cards: everyone has them
