Use GMQCC for everything except the menu quakeC. FTEQCC creates errors in 
the game code, specifically the weapon system macros.
-------------------------------------------------
If you are using FTEQCC and get a "Too many types" error:

	************ ERROR ************
	Too many types
	Error in ../common/util.qc on line 2512
	
Go into the fteqcc source:
(cd ~/xonotic-concrete/xonotic/fteqcc)
fteqcc/qccmain.c
go to line 2911.
Change:
	MAX_FUNCTIONS	= 16384;
	maxtypeinfos	= 16384;
To:
	MAX_FUNCTIONS	= 32768;
	maxtypeinfos	= 32768;
	
If you get "Too many fields" error:
	:2: error: Too many fields. Limit is 4096
	************ ERROR ************
	
go to line 2909.
Change:
	MAX_FIELDS		= 1<<12;
To:
	MAX_FIELDS		= 1<<17;


Recompile FTEQCC (make clean; make)
Try your compile again, it will work.
-------------------------------------------------

For some reason when compiling with the gmqcc "stack", alternative menu languages
do not work. Something is probably misconfigured.

When compiling with the fteqcc "stack" menu languages work, but there are bugs
in fteqcc that cause game problems.

So the solution, so far, is to first compile with fteqcc.
then move ../menu.dat to somewhere else.

Then in qcsrc make clean.
Then compile qith gmqcc.

Then copy over the "old" menu.dat .
Then everything works.

I think the menu system is in C++ so I don't know why this matters.

----
If you compile a "final" version with fteqcc weapon dropping with the extended
weaponsets will not work correctly. Who knows why. You'll lose random weapons.
Sometimes you will gain a weapon.

However fteqcc can catch some (quake c) code errors that gmqcc does not (using global 
names you shouldn't use etc), So it's useful to compile in fteqcc often to check.
