Vehicles and Monsters that use .iqm files work fine on the version of darkplaces
that chaosesque is written for (which has been branched off since then and
maintained for important fixes (source is in a zip file on the .iso))

Newer darkplaces engines may have problems with them, but that is an issue
with the newer code. ChaosEsque will continue to use the version of the engine
it was written for.


<oftc-webi> I've tried
<oftc-webi> difficult to export via blender
<oftc-webi> all the sources are available on the git repo, I make sure of that
<oftc-webi> code sources are included in the .iso (and map sources), but it would be too big to include al the media sources
<oftc-webi> Mario lordhavoc or divverent did fix the invisible iqm bug at one time when I reported it a year ago
<oftc-webi> that fix may have been reverted
<oftc-webi> also I keep to an older branch of dp because newwer ones don't work as well on intel gfx chipsets
<oftc-webi> problems with reflecting water etc arrise on newer ones
<oftc-webi> it may be faster, but I think it's only for nvidia and radiant really
<Mario> dropping some of the stock xonotic maps would help with the file size
<Mario> maps like lightspeed are just deadweight
<oftc-webi> not by much at all
<oftc-webi> most of the iso is textures
<oftc-webi> (as for most games)
<oftc-webi> the .bsp and .maps compressed are tiny in comparrison
<oftc-webi> but hey, maybe soon we'll have blueray
<oftc-webi> your code is all GPL right?
<Mario> indeed
<oftc-webi> I've added alot of monsters using your monster code
<oftc-webi> skeletons all that stuff
<oftc-webi> and extended your zombie apocolypse mutator alot to support the added monsters
<oftc-webi> my added code ofcourse is very... procedural and sucky (if thens), like a beginner C, but ohwell
<Mario> if only you'd waited a little longer... the final product is much cleaner
<oftc-webi> I might beable to backport some things.
<oftc-webi> features etc
<oftc-webi> it would have been ruined by my extentions anyway
<oftc-webi> I'm not a good coder
<oftc-webi> but I test alot to make up for that
<oftc-webi> every hr of coding seems to get 2 hrs of testing every which way
<oftc-webi> I fixed some crashing bugs in the QC in various areas of xonotic.
<oftc-webi> over the year or 2
<Mario> i was able to get 2 of your vehicles working partially in the latest code
<Mario> but, the tags were lost, so it wasnt that great

<oftc-webi> here are the model sources:
<Mario> ive got the sources from the git
<oftc-webi> http://chaosesqueanthology.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=chaosesqueanthology/mediasource;a=tree
<oftc-webi> The bones for the tags are often on a different layer in blender
<oftc-webi> and I often make various LOD meshes
<oftc-webi> (thus the tags/bones in diff layer)
<oftc-webi> for some models I have a readme that explains it
<oftc-webi> (t27 tank etc)
<oftc-webi> everything works if using the dp version in the iso (comes with source in a .zip file) and the code there
<Mario> problem with that version is, it lacks r_glsl_skeletal
<oftc-webi> over the years I've learned you have to package everything you can with whatever you make, otherwise it work work in a year or 2
<oftc-webi> Mario yea, that made the iqms dissappear for a few months
<oftc-webi> then divverent fixed the iqm problem
<oftc-webi> when I found the commit that broke them
<oftc-webi> I don't know what the state of dp is now, but it was fixed for abit atleast
<oftc-webi> I maintain a code branch that supports divvrerents "bend all the way down" playermodels too:
<Mario> if it was fixed, then there must be a commit somewhere that shows exactly what was changed to break it
<oftc-webi> http://chaosesqueanthology.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=chaosesqueanthology/unstable-xonotic-data;a=summary
<oftc-webi> Mario: yea, there is a tracker post I made at some point that found the break
<oftc-webi> wonder what name I used...
<oftc-webi> here it is"
<oftc-webi> http://pastebin.com/4JZrNqxM
<oftc-webi> found that git output in my notes file
<oftc-webi> 5c9d806b99ac9ffda51a3815f25be208e5637864 is the bad one
